**Math is Fun**

If: A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4, â€¦, Z=26,

Then:<br>
K-N-O-W-L-E-D-G-E = 11+14+15+23+12+5+4+7+5 = 96%

And:<br>
H-A-R-D-W-O-R-K = 8+1+18+4+23+15+18+11 = 98%

But to arrive at 100%, we need:<br>
A-T-T-I-T-U-D-E = 1+20+20+9+20+21+4+5 = 100% <br>

This Python program finds random words from an English Dictionary whose scores are also equal to 100. 
The results obtained from running the script gave us some very fascinating and interesting words. The following words 
also have their score equal to 100%.<br> 
PROFILES<br>
MINUSES<br>
STATUS<br>
STRESS<br>
STRAINS<br>
PROBLEMS<br>
HOSPITAL<br>

_There are many more such words. Run the script and find out by yourself._
